THE BIGGER PICTURE:
This app is just a small piece of a larger app. We plan to use different resource managemnt apps to enable small business that
are just starting off to be able to easilly organize their data and display said data for their eomployees. This ranges
everything from scheduling, to inventory, to new work orders.

There are plenty of apps in the world that utilize these resource management methods. We come in with an entire bundle.
The Bigger Picture allows for FULL SPECTRUM resource management. This environmental tool will allow a small business to rely on one
app rather than several smaller apps. This brings simplicity and universal communication through one medium.

Right now we are focusing on one app, or "feature", called Scheduler. Using MERN stack technology we plan to display a calendar and a
list of employees for an admin to easily place employees at specific Projects on specific days, and times. The overall goal is cut
down on time it takes to manually create these weekly schedules. Most small business will use a simple excel spreadsheet that is edited
every week. We understand schedules change every week so we made this manual editing as quick and easy possible so admins have time to
focus on more important tasks.

Labor is a the most expensive part of any business. By creating efficient processes to to handle resource management business can cut
hours or possibly entire positions as the time it takes to complete tasks is cut down siginificantly. We plan to innovate as many
business methods as possible from material to labor by providing small businesses with a competitive edge in their internal processes
